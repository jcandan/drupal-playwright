# This file contains .gitignore rules that are often used with Drupal projects.
# Because .gitignore is specific to your site and its deployment processes, you
# may need to uncomment, add, or remove rules.
#
# This particular .gitignore file is a combination of the patch found at
# https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3082958 and the Pantheon Drops 8
# packages ignore directives at
# https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer/blob/master/.gitignore.


# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
#
# Typically, settings.php and related files are not committed to the
# repository because they contain information such as the database
# credentials that could be used to compromise a site. Sometimes,
# a settings.php might be committed to the repository if it reads
# sensitive information from environment variables or other sources.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
/web/sites/*/settings*.php
/web/sites/*/services*.yml

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
/web/sites/*/files
/web/sites/*/private

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.
/web/sites/simpletest

# Ignore directories generated by Composer
#
# See the "installer-paths" section in the top-level composer.json
# file.

# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
/vendor/

# Ignore scaffold files
#
# Note that the scaffold plugin may be used to automatically manage
# a site's .gitignore files. If the `vendor` directory is ignored,
# then one or more .gitignore files will be written to also ignore
# any file placed by scaffolding. To avoid the creation of
# additional .gitignore files, add all of the scaffold file
# locations to the top-level .gitignore file, as shown below.
